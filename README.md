# FizzBuzz
A simple resolution to a common algorithm excercise.

## The problem
**Print to the console a range of numbers 100 to 1, replacing those whitch are divisible by 3 with "Fizz", by 5 with "Buzz" and by both with "FizzBuzz".**

*Example:*
Buzz
Fizz
98
97
Fizz
Buzz
94
Fizz
92
91
FizzBuzz
89
(...)

## The solution
We use two examples of solution:
- one by making a *for* loop and running the conditions to see if numbers are divided by 3 ou 5;
- other by making a recursive loop, running the same chacks again.
